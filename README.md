# ðŸ§  Data Science Project: Predicting Student Placement Using ML & DL

Welcome to my Data Science project! This repository showcases a comprehensive approach to predicting **student placement outcomes** based on their college academic performance using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The goal is to help identify factors that contribute to successful placements and make data-driven recommendations for students and institutions.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Scikit-learn**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, KNN
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: ANN for deep learning model
- **Jupyter Notebook**: interactive development

## âœ… Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed missing values, handled duplicates, and outlier detection
   - Normalized/standardized numerical values for ML models

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed distributions of IQ', 'Prev_Sem_Result', 'CGPA', 'Academic_Performance',
       'Internship_Experience', 'Extra_Curricular_Score',
       'Communication_Skills', 'Projects_Completed', 'Placement'
   - Heatmaps and correlation matrices to identify key influencing factors

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoded categorical features like branch, gender, and internships
   - Created aggregate scores and performance indices

4. **Model Building**
   - **ML Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, 
   - **Deep Learning**: Artificial Neural Networks using Keras with dropout layers and ReLU activations

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
   - Confusion Matrix and Classification Reports for all models
